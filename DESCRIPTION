Description: Perform financial event study analysis in R. Implements the
    classical event study methodology ('MacKinlay' 1997) with multiple return
    models (Market Model, Market Adjusted, Comparison Period Mean Adjusted,
    'Fama'-French 3- and 5-factor, 'Carhart' 4-factor, GARCH), parametric and
    non-parametric test statistics, buy-and-hold abnormal returns ('BHAR'),
    volume and volatility event studies, cross-sectional regression,
    'intraday' event studies, panel ('DiD') event studies, and visualization
    tools. Results can be exported to CSV, Excel, or 'LaTeX'.
